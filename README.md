# BrainBlitz

An app designed for AtomHacks, an 8 hour hackathon. 

## Description
BrainBlitz is an innovative and futuristic educational app that offers an interactive study experience with an AI chatbot based on the GPT 3.5 Turbo model. With BrainBlitz, users can create and play games to study a wide range of topics. The app allows users to control the topic, number of questions, and difficulty level for a customized learning experience.

When using BrainBlitz, you're able to authenticate yourself through Google OAuth2. The server uses Firebase to store data about your profile (linked to your Google account), such as your statistics and the games you've played. You're able to see your own stats from the games you've played, and create a game. When creating a game, you will be asked questions on demand by an AI chatbot. When answering, the bot gives you an instant rating, feedback, and queries you once again. The bot then grades your overall performance and gives you overall feedback.

The app's engaging format makes studying more enjoyable, fostering effective learning. By combining AI technology with educational games, BrainBlitz revolutionizes the way people study and enhances the learning process.
